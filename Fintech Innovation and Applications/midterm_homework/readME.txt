My program have two modes:
    1. change to mode 0 if you want to mine the nonce, you just need to change the value of mode.
    2. change to mode 1 if you already know the nonce and want to verify the hash, you just need to change the value of nonce and mode. Notice that you need to put the testcase file which teacher provided and the program in the same folder.    
    3. $ python3 testcase.py
